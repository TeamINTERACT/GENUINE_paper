## Abstract

**Background** The relationship between gentrification and health is complex. Researchers, policy makers, and urban planners need data and tools to better understand this complex relationship. The Gentrification, Urban Interventions, and Equity (GENUINE) Tool is an open-access map-based tool that allows users to explore and incorporate measures of gentrification for Canadian cities in their work.  
**Data and methods** The phenomenon of gentrification manifests differently across cities. We developed the GENUINE tool by adapting four published gentrification measures that have been used in the U.S. and Canada. The measures rely on different combinations of change in Census indicators related to income, housing, occupation, education, and age. We computed these measures for all census tracts within the 36 Canadian Census Metropolitan Areas to identify gentrifiable areas in 2006, and those which gentrified between 2006 and 2016.  
**Results** Depending on the measure, by 2016, 2% to 20% of census tracts had experienced gentrification; corresponding to 2% (418,065 people) to 17% (4,266,434) of the Canadian population living in gentrified areas. Generally, metropolitan areas with populations over 1 million had a greater proportion of their population living in gentrified areas (2%–18%) compared to metros with fewer than 250,000 residents (1%–14%).  
**Interpretation** With the attention toward healthy cities only expanding, GENUINE provides pan-Canadian indicators of gentrification, which can be anintegral part of solution-oriented research and advancing cities towards designing healthy and equitable communities.
